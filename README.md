# UNICE (Code Skeleton – Flutter)

UNICE is a **mobile communication app** designed for seamless **audio/video calling** and **live translation** features, built using **Flutter** and third-party SDKs.

> ⚠️ _This version is a redacted code skeleton. All sensitive business logic, API integrations, and UI implementations have been removed to respect client confidentiality._  
> This repo is for **portfolio and architectural demonstration** purposes only.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- Cross-platform Flutter architecture
- Modular separation of core features: calling, translation, utilities
- Setup ready for integrating video/audio SDKs (e.g., Agora, Twilio, Jitsi)
- Clean dependency injection and state management practices
- Environment-based configurations for dev/prod
- Organized structure for maintainability and scalability

## 🚧 What's Included
 - Clean modular folder layout
 - Environment-based build system (prod, development)
 - Sample main entry points for each flavor
 - CI-ready structure for scalable Flutter apps
 - Modular architecture for scalable development
 - Dependency Injection (DI) structure with di.config.dart, register_modules.dart
 - Isolated network layer using dio_wrapper
 - Folder-based separation of datasources, repository, usecases wallet_adapter_service, permissions, chat_scoket, stream_calling_service and l10n
 - Strong use of reusable widgets and utils
 - Environment-specific configuration using base_env.dart
 - Custom routing with go_router

## ❌ What's Removed (for confidentiality)
 - Business logic, UI code, API calls
 - Client assets, endpoints, auth flows
 - Actual functionality (this is not a runnable app)

## 🚀 Tech Stack
 - Flutter (Stable Channel)
 - Dart
 - Flavor-based environment config
 - Lint for code consistency (package)
